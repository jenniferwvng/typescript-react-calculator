# Typescript Calculator

## Background
Using Typescript to code a calculator app simulating the native calculator app design in Apple phones.
Aim is to get a hang of what Typescript is about, progress while building this project and subsequently add more type checks to the code.

Chose to make a calculator as the code base won't be too big and while it requires some programming logic for the calculations, it also gives different opportunities to use with Typescript, like event listeners, state hooks etc.
